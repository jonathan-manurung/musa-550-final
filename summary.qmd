In summary, the increase from 0.74 to 0.79 after adding 9 spatial features suggests an improvement and enhanced the predictive performance of house price prediction model. 

The increase also suggest that the spatial features added, such as internal characteristic from property assessment, public amenity and disamenity features, and crimes, provide contribution in building a more accurate prediction model. Means that there are spatial patterns of neighborhood characteristic that affect the house prices.
